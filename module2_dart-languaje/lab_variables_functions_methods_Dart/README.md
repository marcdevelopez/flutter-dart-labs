---

## üéØ Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Declare and initialize variables in Dart.
- Use different data types and understand their purpose.
- Define and call functions.
- Work with methods inside classes.
- Understand type inference, constants, and `final` variables.

## üß± Steps Implemented

| Step | Topic             | Description                                                                         |
| ---- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2    | Variables         | Declare and print variables of different types (`int`, `double`, `String`, `bool`). |
| 3    | Data Types        | Work with `List`, `Map`, and nullable types.                                        |
| 4    | Type Inference    | Compare `var` vs explicit type annotations.                                         |
| 5    | Constants & Final | Difference between `const` (compile time) and `final` (runtime).                    |
| 6    | Functions         | Define and call simple functions with parameters.                                   |
| 7    | Classes           | Create a class with constructor and method.                                         |
